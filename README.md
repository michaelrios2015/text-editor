# text-editor

A simple text editor built for Data structures and algorithms class hopefully can just be downloaded compliled and run

These were the instructions:

Write a program in Java that simulates a simple line editor which supports the following operations:

 $insert
Each subsequent line, up to the next line editor command, will be inserted in the text. If there is a designated current line, each line is inserted before that current line. Otherwise each line is inserted at the end of the text

 $delete m n
Each line in text between lines m and n inclusively will be deleted

 $print m n
	Display the lines m and n inclusively along with their line
     numbers. If the parameters m and n are missing, print the
     entire text

 $line m
	Line m becomes the current line. The program should display       up to 3 lines of text along with their line numbers before
     and after the current line depending on whether there is
     enough text in the linked list
 
$search string	
	Search for the string in the text. If found, display the line
     that contains the first occurrence of the string

 $done
	Terminates the execution
